===========================================================
🌟 1. AMateria

🔹 This is an abstract interface — think of it like a blueprint or contract.
🔹 It says: “All Materia must have some common behaviors like being used or copied.”
🔹 But it doesn’t do anything itself — it just says what should be done, not how.

🧠 Think of it like:

    "All tools must be usable and duplicable. I won’t tell you how. That’s your job."

❄️ 2. Ice and ❤️ Cure

🔹 These are real, concrete versions of the abstract idea "Materia."
🔹 They follow the AMateria blueprint.
🔹 "Ice" might hurt someone with ice; "Cure" might heal them.
🔹 They actually do something, unlike the blueprint.

🧠 Think of it like:

    If "AMateria" is a recipe, then "Ice" and "Cure" are real dishes made from that recipe.
===========================================================


===========================================================
🧍 3. ICharacter and Character

🔹 ICharacter is another interface — a blueprint for a character.
🔹 It says: “A character should be able to wear Materia, use them, etc.”
🔹 Character is a real person in your program that follows this blueprint.

🧠 Think of it like:

    "ICharacter" is the idea of a person (a job description).
    "Character" is the actual person doing the job.
===========================================================

===========================================================
📚 4. IMateriaSource and MateriaSource

🔹 IMateriaSource is a blueprint for a factory or library of Materia.
🔹 It says: “You should be able to learn new Materia and make copies.”
🔹 MateriaSource is a real object that stores known Materia and creates new ones.

🧠 Think of it like:

    "IMateriaSource" is the idea of a Materia factory.
    "MateriaSource" is the real factory that produces them.
